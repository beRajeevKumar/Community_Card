## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

By the end of this project, I learned how to create a single price grid component using HTML and CSS. I also learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive design.

Some code snippets that I am proud of are:

```html
<p class="price"><span> &dollar;29</span>per month</p>

<li>Peer &amp; expert code review</li>
```

```css
@media (max-width: 620px) {
  html {
    font-size: 50%;
  }
}
@media (max-width: 490px) {
  html {
    font-size: 50%;
  }
  body {
    margin: 1rem;
  }
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;
  }
  .description {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on improving my CSS skills and learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I will also focus on learning JavaScript to make my projects more interactive.
